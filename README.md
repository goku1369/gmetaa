# MyToken Solidity Contract

This repository contains a basic Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity that implements a simple token contract similar to ERC20 tokens. The contract defines functionalities for minting and burning tokens, and it also tracks token balances for Ethereum addresses.

## Contract Overview

The `MyToken` contract is a basic token implementation that includes the following features:

- **Token Information**: The contract has two public string variables: `tokenName` and `tokenAbbrv`, representing the full name and abbreviation of the token, respectively.

- **Total Supply and Balances**: The contract tracks the total supply of tokens (`totalSupply`) and maintains individual token balances for Ethereum addresses using the `balances` mapping.

- **Minting Tokens**: The `mint` function allows the contract owner to mint new tokens to a specified address. This function increases the total supply and updates the balance of the target address.

- **Burning Tokens**: The `burn` function enables token holders to burn (destroy) a certain amount of their tokens. This function decreases both the total supply and the token balance of the caller's address.

Please be aware that this contract is provided for educational purposes and lacks various features typically found in production-ready token contracts, such as events, allowances, and security mechanisms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum Wallet or Browser Extension (e.g., MetaMask) for interacting with Ethereum contracts.
- Some Ether for deploying and interacting with the contract on the Ethereum network.
- Solidity Compiler (0.8.18 or compatible) for compiling the contract code.

### Deployment

1. Compile the `MyToken` contract using the Solidity compiler.

2. Deploy the compiled contract to the Ethereum network using your preferred method, such as Remix, Truffle, or a deployment script. Make sure to specify appropriate constructor arguments, if any.

3. After deployment, you will receive the contract's address, which you can use to interact with the contract's functions.

## Usage

### Minting Tokens

To mint new tokens to a specific Ethereum address, follow these steps:

1. Connect your Ethereum wallet or browser extension to the Ethereum network.

2. Access the deployed `MyToken` contract using its address.

3. Call the `mint` function, providing the target Ethereum address and the number of tokens to mint as arguments.

### Burning Tokens

To burn (destroy) existing tokens held by a specific Ethereum address, follow these steps:

1. Connect your Ethereum wallet or browser extension to the Ethereum network.

2. Access the deployed `MyToken` contract using its address.

3. Call the `burn` function, providing the amount of tokens to burn as an argument. Ensure that you have a sufficient balance of tokens to burn.
